## Programming exercises

Used to quickly catch up with a new programming language

## Exercises

1. Define a function halve :: [a] -> ([a],[a]) that splits an even-lengthed list into two halves.

2. Define a function third :: [a] -> a that returns the third element in a list that contains at least this many elements

3. The Luhn algorithm is used to check bank card numbers for simple errors such as mistyping a digit, and proceeds as follows:

- consider each digit as a separate number;
- moving left, double every other number from the second last;
- subtract 9 from each number that is now greater than 9;
- add all the resulting numbers together;
- if the total is divisible by 10, the card number is valid.

4. Calculates the sum 1^2 + 2^2 + ... 100^2 of the first one hundred integer squares.

5. Implement `replicate`, eg: `replicate 3 true = [true, true, true]`

6. Write function that returns all Pythagorean whose components are at most a given limit.

7. A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself.
Write a function that returns the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit.

8. Write a function that returns dot production of two vectors.

9. Define a recursive function `euclid :: Int -> Int -> Int `
that implements Euclidâ€™s algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers: 
if the two numbers are equal, this number is the result; otherwise, the smaller number is subtracted from the larger,
and the same process is then repeated.

10. Implement merge sort

11. Define `dec2int :: [Int] -> Int` using fold. Eg: `dec2int [2 3 4 5] = 2345`

12. Implement `unfold`, where:

```haskell
unfold p h t x | p x = []
               | otherwise = h x : unfold p h t (t x)
```

Use unfold to implement:

- int2bin
- map f
- iterate f

13. Define `altMap :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b], eg:

```haskell
altMap (+10) (+100) [0,1,2,3,4] = [10,101,12,103,14]
```
